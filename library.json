    "description": "The FlashStorage_STM32 library aims to provide a convenient way to store and retrieve user's data using the non-volatile flash memory of STM32F/L/H/G/WB/MP1. It's using the buffered read and write to minimize the access to Flash. It now supports writing and reading the whole object, not just byte-and-byte.",
